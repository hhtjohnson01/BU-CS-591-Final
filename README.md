# BU-CS-591-Final

Pivot from the original idea of an all-encompassing, more interactive MMA app, this one simply gives you fighter details (record, skill breakdown, striking/takedown breakdowns, etc.) as well as where to (possibly) watch MMA events near your location and an expansive Twitter feed drawing from searches on various MMA related hashtags to deliver you the news you want and need as an avid MMA fan.

This project uses Twitter, mma-api, and Google Places and Geolocation to achieve the functions as stated above. It has both (working) local and Oauth login, using Twitter. It is a MEAN stack application.

The pivot was caused by the other API I wanted to use seemingly not being up-to-date, with the most recent event I found being from 2013.

Expanded functionality of the app in the future would include: getting an event list and adding these events to your calendar (with alerts), saving favorite fighters and getting updates if they have an upcoming fight, interactive scorecards to score fights as you watch them, live betting odd updates, link to buying event tickets (for large-scale and local-level events), and live community converstaion between users that are currently on the site. Changes would ideally be made to also have tweets be sent directly from the page, without redirecting to Twitter first.

The app, as it stands, is not out for production. If I decide to do that, it will be with the above added functionality and changes to the logos, as I don't have the rights to them (Logojoy screenshots of logos created just for me, but not paid for). Everything sensitive has been configured out and is only local.
